This document describes and comments Org syntax as it is currently
read by its parser (Org Elements) and, therefore, by the export
framework.  It also includes a few comments on that syntax.

A core concept in this syntax is that only headlines, sections,
planning lines and property drawers are context-free[fn:1][fn:2].
Every other syntactical part only exists within specific environments.

Three categories are used to classify these environments: "Greater
elements", "elements", and "objects", from the broadest scope to the
narrowest.  The word "element" is used for both Greater and non-Greater
elements, the context should make that clear.

The paragraph is the unit of measurement.  An element defines
syntactical parts that are at the same level as a paragraph,
i.e. which cannot contain or be included in a paragraph.  An object is
a part that could be included in an element.  Greater elements are all
parts that can contain an element.

Empty lines belong to the largest element ending before them.  For
example, in a list, empty lines between items are part of the
item before them, but empty lines at the end of a list belong to the
plain list element.

Unless specified otherwise, case is not significant.

* Headlines and Sections
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: Headlines_and_Sections
  :END:

  A headline is defined as:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  STARS KEYWORD PRIORITY TITLE TAGS
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  STARS is a string starting at column 0, containing at least one
  asterisk (and up to ~org-inlinetask-min-level~ if =org-inlinetask=
  library is loaded) and ended by a space character.  The number of
  asterisks is used to define the level of the headline.  It's the
  sole compulsory part of a headline.

  KEYWORD is a TODO keyword, which has to belong to the list defined
  in ~org-todo-keywords-1~.  Case is significant.

  PRIORITY is a priority cookie, i.e. a single letter preceded by
  a hash sign # and enclosed within square brackets.

  TITLE can be made of any character but a new line.  Though, it will
  match after every other part have been matched.

  TAGS is made of words containing any alpha-numeric character,
  underscore, at sign, hash sign or percent sign, and separated with
  colons.

  Examples of valid headlines include:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ,*

  ,** DONE

  ,*** Some e-mail

  ,**** TODO [#A] COMMENT Title :tag:a2%:
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  If the first word appearing in the title is "COMMENT", the headline
  will be considered as "commented".  Case is significant.

  If its title is ~org-footnote-section~, it will be considered as
  a "footnote section".  Case is significant.

  If "ARCHIVE" is one of its tags, it will be considered as
  "archived".  Case is significant.

  A headline contains directly one section (optionally), followed by
  any number of deeper level headlines.

  A section contains directly any greater element or element.  Only
  a headline can contain a section.  As an exception, text before the
  first headline in the document also belongs to a section.

  As an example, consider the following document:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  An introduction.

  ,* A Headline

    Some text.

  ,** Sub-Topic 1

  ,** Sub-Topic 2

  ,*** Additional entry
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  Its internal structure could be summarized as:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (document
   (section)
   (headline
    (section)
    (headline)
    (headline
     (headline))))
  #+END_EXAMPLE

* Affiliated Keywords
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: Affiliated_keywords
  :END:

  With the exception of comment, clocks, headlines, inlinetasks,
  items, node properties, planning, property drawers, sections, and
  table rows, every other element type can be assigned attributes.

  This is done by adding specific keywords, named "affiliated
  keywords", just above the element considered, no blank line
  allowed.

  Affiliated keywords are built upon one of the following patterns:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ,#+KEY: VALUE
  ,#+KEY[OPTIONAL]: VALUE
  ,#+ATTR_BACKEND: VALUE
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  KEY is either "CAPTION", "HEADER", "NAME", "PLOT" or "RESULTS"
  string.

  BACKEND is a string constituted of alpha-numeric characters, hyphens
  or underscores.

  OPTIONAL and VALUE can contain any character but a new line.  Only
  "CAPTION" and "RESULTS" keywords can have an optional value.

  An affiliated keyword can appear more than once if KEY is either
  "CAPTION" or "HEADER" or if its pattern is "#+ATTR_BACKEND: VALUE".

  "CAPTION", "AUTHOR", "DATE" and "TITLE" keywords can contain objects
  in their value and their optional value, if applicable.

* Greater Elements
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: Greater_Elements
  :END:

  Unless specified otherwise, greater elements can contain directly
  any other element or greater element except:

  - elements of their own type,
  - node properties, which can only be found in property drawers,
  - items, which can only be found in plain lists.

** Greater Blocks
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: Greater_Blocks
   :END:

   Greater blocks consist in the following pattern:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   ,#+BEGIN_NAME PARAMETERS
   CONTENTS
   ,#+END_NAME
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   NAME can contain any non-whitespace character.

   PARAMETERS can contain any character other than new line, and can
   be omitted.

   If NAME is "CENTER", it will be a "center block".  If it is
   "QUOTE", it will be a "quote block".

   If the block is neither a center block, a quote block or a block
   element, it will be a "special block".

   CONTENTS can contain any element, except a line =#+END_NAME= on
   its own.  Also lines beginning with STARS must be quoted by
   a comma.

** Drawers and Property Drawers
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: Drawers
   :END:

   Pattern for drawers is:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   :NAME:
   CONTENTS
   :END:
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   NAME can contain word-constituent characters, hyphens and
   underscores.

   CONTENTS can contain any element but another drawer.

** Dynamic Blocks
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: Dynamic_Blocks
   :END:

   Pattern for dynamic blocks is:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   ,#+BEGIN: NAME PARAMETERS
   CONTENTS
   ,#+END:
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   NAME cannot contain any whitespace character.

   PARAMETERS can contain any character and can be omitted.

** Footnote Definitions
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: Footnote_Definitions
   :END:

   Pattern for footnote definitions is:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   [fn:LABEL] CONTENTS
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   It must start at column 0.

   LABEL is either a number or follows the pattern "fn:WORD", where
   word can contain any word-constituent character, hyphens and
   underscore characters.

   CONTENTS can contain any element excepted another footnote
   definition.  It ends at the next footnote definition, the next
   headline, two consecutive empty lines or the end of buffer.

** Inlinetasks
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: Inlinetasks
   :END:

   Inlinetasks are defined by ~org-inlinetask-min-level~ contiguous
   asterisk characters starting at column 0, followed by a whitespace
   character.

   Optionally, inlinetasks can be ended with a string constituted of
   ~org-inlinetask-min-level~ contiguous asterisk characters starting
   at column 0, followed by a space and the "END" string.

   Inlinetasks are recognized only after =org-inlinetask= library is
   loaded.

** Plain Lists and Items
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: Plain_Lists_and_Items
   :END:

   Items are defined by a line starting with the following pattern:
   "BULLET COUNTER-SET CHECK-BOX TAG", in which only BULLET is
   mandatory.

   BULLET is either an asterisk, a hyphen, a plus sign character or
   follows either the pattern "COUNTER." or "COUNTER)".  In any case,
   BULLET is follwed by a whitespace character or line ending.

   COUNTER can be a number or a single letter.

   COUNTER-SET follows the pattern [@COUNTER].

   CHECK-BOX is either a single whitespace character, a "X" character
   or a hyphen, enclosed within square brackets.

   TAG follows "TAG-TEXT ::" pattern, where TAG-TEXT can contain any
   character but a new line.

   An item ends before the next item, the first line less or equally
   indented than its starting line, or two consecutive empty lines.
   Indentation of lines within other greater elements do not count,
   neither do inlinetasks boundaries.

   A plain list is a set of consecutive items of the same indentation.
   It can only directly contain items.

   If first item in a plain list has a counter in its bullet, the
   plain list will be an "ordered plain-list".  If it contains a tag,
   it will be a "descriptive list".  Otherwise, it will be an
   "unordered list".  List types are mutually exclusive.

   For example, consider the following excerpt of an Org document:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   1. item 1
   2. [X] item 2
      - some tag :: item 2.1
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   Its internal structure is as follows:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   (ordered-plain-list
    (item)
    (item
     (descriptive-plain-list
      (item))))
   #+END_EXAMPLE

** Property Drawers
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: Property_Drawers
   :END:

   Property drawers are a special type of drawer containing properties
   attached to a headline.  They are located right after a headline
   and its planning information.

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   HEADLINE
   PROPERTYDRAWER

   HEADLINE
   PLANNING
   PROPERTYDRAWER
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   PROPERTYDRAWER follows the pattern

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   :PROPERTIES:
   CONTENTS
   :END:
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   where CONTENTS consists of zero or more node properties.

** Tables
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: Tables
   :END:

   Tables start at lines beginning with either a vertical bar or the
   "+-" string followed by plus or minus signs only, assuming they are
   not preceded with lines of the same type.  These lines can be
   indented.

   A table starting with a vertical bar has "org" type.  Otherwise it
   has "table.el" type.

   Org tables end at the first line not starting with a vertical bar.
   Table.el tables end at the first line not starting with either
   a vertical line or a plus sign.  Such lines can be indented.

   An org table can only contain table rows.  A table.el table does
   not contain anything.

   One or more "#+TBLFM: FORMULAS" lines, where "FORMULAS" can contain
   any character, can follow an org table.

* Elements
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: Elements
  :END:

  Elements cannot contain any other element.

   CONTENTS
   ,#+END_NAME
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   NAME cannot contain any whitespace character.

   If NAME is "COMMENT", it will be a "comment block".  If it is
   "EXAMPLE", it will be an "example block".  If it is "EXPORT", it
   will be an "export block".  If it is "SRC", it will be a "source
   block".  If it is "VERSE", it will be a "verse block".

   DATA can contain any character but a new line.  It can be ommitted,
   unless the block is either a "source block" or an "export block".

   In the latter case, it should be constituted of a single word.

   In the former case, it must follow the pattern "LANGUAGE SWITCHES
   ARGUMENTS", where SWITCHES and ARGUMENTS are optional.

   LANGUAGE cannot contain any whitespace character.

   SWITCHES is made of any number of "SWITCH" patterns, separated by
   blank lines.

   A SWITCH pattern is either "-l "FORMAT"", where FORMAT can contain
   any character but a double quote and a new line, "-S" or "+S",
   where S stands for a single letter.

   ARGUMENTS can contain any character but a new line.

   CONTENTS can contain any character, including new lines.  Though it
   will only contain Org objects if the block is a verse block.
   Otherwise, CONTENTS will not be parsed.

   DURATION follows the pattern:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   => HH:MM
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   HH is a number containing any number of digits.  MM is a two digit
   numbers.

   A diary sexp is a line starting at column 0 with "%%(" string.  It
   can then contain any character besides a new line.

   A planning is an element with the following pattern:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   HEADLINE
   PLANNING
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   where HEADLINE is a headline element and PLANNING is a line filled
   with INFO parts, where each of them follows the pattern:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   KEYWORD: TIMESTAMP
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   KEYWORD is either "DEADLINE", "SCHEDULED" or "CLOSED".  TIMESTAMP
   is a timestamp object.

   BORDER2 is any non-whitespace character different from ~,~, ~.~ and
   ~$~.

   #+ATTR_ASCII: :width 5
   -----

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   It would introduce incompatibilities with previous Org versions,
   but support for ~$...$~ (and for symmetry, ~$$...$$~) constructs
   ought to be removed.

   They are slow to parse, fragile, redundant and imply false
   positives.  --- ngz
   #+END_QUOTE

   DEFINITION can contain any character.  Though opening and closing
   square brackets must be balanced in it.  It can contain any object
   encountered in a paragraph, even other footnote references.

   If the reference follows the second pattern, it is called an
   "inline footnote".  If it follows the third one, i.e. if LABEL is
   omitted, it is an "anonymous footnote".

   #+END_EXAMPLE

   SEXP can contain any character excepted ~>~ and ~\n~.

   DATE follows the pattern:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   YYYY-MM-DD DAYNAME
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   ~Y~, ~M~ and ~D~ are digits.  DAYNAME can contain any non
   whitespace-character besides ~+~, ~-~, ~]~, ~>~, a digit or ~\n~.

   TIME follows the pattern ~H:MM~.  ~H~ can be one or two digit long
   and can start with 0.

   REPEATER-OR-DELAY follows the pattern:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   MARK VALUE UNIT
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   MARK is ~+~ (cumulate type), ~++~ (catch-up type) or ~.+~ (restart
   type) for a repeater, and ~-~ (all type) or ~--~ (first type) for
   warning delays.

   VALUE is a number.

   UNIT is a character among ~h~ (hour), ~d~ (day), ~w~ (week), ~m~
   (month), ~y~ (year).

   MARK, VALUE and UNIT are not separated by whitespace characters.

   There can be two REPEATER-OR-DELAY in the timestamp: one as
   a repeater and one as a warning delay.

** Text Markup
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: Emphasis_Markers
   :END:

   Text markup follows the pattern:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   PRE MARKER CONTENTS MARKER POST
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   PRE is a whitespace character, ~(~, ~{~ ~'~ or a double quote.  It
   can also be a beginning of line.

   MARKER is a character among ~*~ (bold), ~=~ (verbatim), ~/~
   (italic), ~+~ (strike-through), ~_~ (underline), ~~~ (code).

   CONTENTS is a string following the pattern:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   BORDER BODY BORDER
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   BORDER can be any non-whitespace character excepted ~,~, ~'~ or
   a double quote.

   BODY can contain contain any character but may not span over more
   than 3 lines.

   BORDER and BODY are not separated by whitespaces.

   CONTENTS can contain any object encountered in a paragraph when
   markup is "bold", "italic", "strike-through" or "underline".

   POST is a whitespace character, ~-~, ~.~, ~,~, ~:~, ~!~, ~?~, ~'~,
   ~)~, ~}~ or a double quote.  It can also be an end of line.

   PRE, MARKER, CONTENTS, MARKER and POST are not separated by
   whitespace characters.

   #+ATTR_ASCII: :width 5
   -----

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   All of this is wrong if ~org-emphasis-regexp-components~ or
   ~org-emphasis-alist~ are modified.

   This should really be simplified.

   Also, CONTENTS should be anything within code and verbatim
   emphasis, by definition.  --- ngz
   #+END_QUOTE

* Footnotes

[fn:1] In particular, the parser requires stars at column 0 to be
quoted by a comma when they do not define a headline.

[fn:2] It also means that only headlines and sections can be
recognized just by looking at the beginning of the line.  Planning
lines and property drawers can be recognized by looking at one or two
lines above.

As a consequence, using ~org-element-at-point~ or
~org-element-context~ will move up to the parent headline, and parse
top-down from there until context around original location is found.
